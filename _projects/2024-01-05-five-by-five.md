Five elements. Five writers. Five genres. Five stories.

A group of writers put their own spin on five shared story elements: a bird; the feeling of water; a mis-delivered package; the chariot tarot card; a guilty pleasure. The result is a delightful mashup of themes and symbol through different genres and styles:

- a Wellington-gothic tale of mermaids and madness
- a far-future story of a drug-running underdog, clawing his way to the top
- a slice-of-life vignette of a young man and his neighbours' hot tub
- a gonzo girls' night out with the ultimate party app
- a ghost story where a jewel thief gets more than he bargains for on a late-night neighbourhood prowl
