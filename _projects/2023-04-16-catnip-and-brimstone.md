>The girl might be redeemed. A cat? Never.

Nine-year-old Beth and her tabby kitten Charley become BFFs from the moment she adopts him. He seems like the perfect pet: well behaved, doesn't shed, and what's more, has "moonlight-dipped ears." But what Beth doesn't know is that Charley was born into a lineage of catmages, and she's too excited about her new pet to heed the warning from the old lady who runs the shelter: He's not come into his power, yet. It's hard to say what his form will take before it happens.

When Charley is catnapped by a strange man in a dark cloak, Beth does everything she can to get him back. But what will happen when Charley does come into his power, and what form will it take? And how can life ever return to normal when Beth and Charley attract the notice of several magical factions with their own agendas?

Catnip & Brimstone is a bittersweet novella about friendship, loyalty, and finding one's own path.
