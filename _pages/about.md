Hi, I'm Jess. I'm a writer who lives in Wellington, New Zealand.

![Moi](/images/jess-nickelsen.jpeg){: .centre :}

Some things about me:

 - I was born in the States, but since then I've lived all over the place: New Zealand, Italy & Ireland, with extended stays in the Netherlands
 - most of my working life has been in IT; I've worked in HR, as a developer, asset manager, report-writer, localisation engineer & software tester
 - as well as working in tech, I've been a film runner, dish washer, performed silver service at a luxury lodge, and been a tour guide operator at a prawn farm (among other things)!
 - I also reviewed video games for ten years for the now-defunct (yet still dear to my heart) NZGamer.com
 - My favourite Studio Ghibli movie is Whisper of the Heart
 - I'm pretty passionate about music: Keith Jarret and Thelonius Monk, Beethoven, Steely Dan and Mr Bungle are some of my desert-island artists
 - sidenote: I could watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaZfXfW6qxA&ab) over and over again...forever? The KÃ¶ln Concert is the album I go to when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I can't figure out what's wrong. And weirdly "Caro Diario" is a little like that for me too.
