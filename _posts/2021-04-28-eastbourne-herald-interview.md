Here's a surprise! I was recently interviewed for the Eastbourne Herald, my
local paper, to talk about _The Dark Offering_ as well as writing under
lockdown. I talk a little bit about what inspired me to take the plunge to
publish these stories. It's my first "proper" interview as a writer (though I
was on the radio for a storytelling group I belonged to as a child) and I was
pretty nervous throughout. It still feels odd to "out" oneself on something that
I never really advertised much in the past.

In any case, enjoy!
