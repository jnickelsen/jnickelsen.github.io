Hey there everyone, this is just a quick post to let you know that my first eBook, _The Dark Offering (and other stories)_ is now available for [pre-order on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XS23JDP/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1).

![Dark Offering cover](/images/books/the-dark-offering-plain-mockup.png){: .centered}

It's a collection of five short stories that all have a little weirdness to them. They're the sort of tales I love reading, and they're really fun to write too. Hopefully the combination of stories aren't too strange! There's a psychological swimming-pool birthday drama, a gothic ghost story, a tongue-in-cheek doppelganger enviro-tale, an angst-ridden kleptomaniac boarding school tragedy, and a thinly-veiled magic-realist story about fishing and dementia.

Do they work? Only time will tell. But I love each one of them dearly, and I hope you do too.

Thanks!
