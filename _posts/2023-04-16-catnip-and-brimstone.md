After sitting on it for longer than I'd like to admit, I'm happy to announce that my novella, _Catnip & Brimstone_ is now available in the kindle store. I'm releasing it as a KDP Select title for now, but will make it available on other shopfronts in the future.

What's it about? A girl and her cat bestie, who just might be about to manifest as a "dark" catmage. The adults in their lives are keen to control how things go, but the duo have other plans in mind...

Purchase from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2LQSJ7L), or my [ko-fi shopfront]( https://ko-fi.com/s/2405b239a2).
