title: A Site Update And New Story For Subscribers
tags: [blog]
---

The site has had quite the update! After tinkering with the old theme for a few years I finally reached the point where it made more sense to wipe everything and start again. So here we have it: same address, but a slightly different structure and feel. Each of my books and stories have their own tile on the front page, and the newsletter sign-up is front-and-centre :)

Speaking of...I've updated the free story offering, from _Catnip & Brimstone_ to ["Last Call at the Stargazer,"](https://www.jessicanickelsen.com/project/last-call-at-the-stargazer) a short story I've put into eBook format. If you are already signed up to the newsletter, please flick me an email at [hello@jessicanickelsen.com](mailto:hello@jessicanickelsen.com) and I will send you a download link.
